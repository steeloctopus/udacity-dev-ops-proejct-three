Master Branch 
This branch contains the files that create the network and servers using cloud formations.  Please note I automatically install jenkins and tidy as part of the CF script.

Pipeline Branch
The branch contains the files for the Jenkins build and the fiel that get copied into the S3 bucket.

Please note that that I use a temporary AWS cloud workspace that get deleted after 4hrs so it is unlikely that you will be able to see live URL's

If you need live URL I can easliy spin this up again.
